# Visual Drive
Project Hosted At: https://visual-drive.herokuapp.com

**About**
 Visual Drive is an IOT project that takes data recorded from a 
 car's OBDII port while on an actual drive and visualizes the data using d3js graphs. 
 The app's visualization is a simulation of a drive on a main road of a large city. 
 As the car drives along, the map will plot the current latitude and longitude of the car, 
 detailing the route taken. The dashboard shows the car's current speed, odometer reading, 
 fuel level reading, engine rpms, current gear status, door open status, and headlight status
